# The-Settlers-of-Catan-PyGame

A Python implementation of _The Settlers of Catan_ using the PyGame library, with the goal of integrating reinforcement learning for intelligent AI opponents.

This project recreates the classic board game _The Settlers of Catan_, featuring a full rule-based engine, custom-built UI, and turn-based gameplay. It is developed in Python and uses PyGame for rendering and interaction. In addition to local multiplayer, the project aims to support a challenging singleplayer mode by training bots using reinforcement learning.

## Features
- Full implementation of core Catan mechanics: resource generation, building, trading, robber logic, and victory points
- Interactive visual game board with hex tiles, roads, settlements, and cities
- Local multiplayer mode
- Singleplayer mode with AI opponents (under development)
- Planned reinforcement learning integration to train competitive bots
- Clean, modular Python codebase suitable for both gameplay and AI experimentation

## Project Goals
- Deliver a faithful digital version of _The Settlers of Catan_
- Provide a sandbox for experimenting with reinforcement learning in board games
- Create a fun and challenging singleplayer experience through intelligent AI opponents
